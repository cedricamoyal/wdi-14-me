<h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>

<h4>Create a route that goes from /games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw to games#rock_paper_scissors_play
Use params[:throw] as a user's choice
Compare the 2! If users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.
i.e. If a user throws rock http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock and the server picks rock player wins! (Yes, I know that is not how RPS works) Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of Rock Paper Scissors.</h4>
